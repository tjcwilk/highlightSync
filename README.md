# highlightSync

# Introduction

HighLightSync a tool that can gather reading highlights collected from one service,
and save them in a different note taking tool.

This is particularly helpful when you read a lot of online digital content, but want
to collect it all together in your own central digital note taking library.

For example, I read a lot of technical articles using the reading service instapaper.
When I read, I highlight the parts that resonate with me. I like to bring these into my
central notes system evernote, so I can review, process and remember the content I read.
